      <p>
        Jo達o works at <a href="https://abyssal.eu">Abyssal SA</a>. When he's not
        doing that, he's lurking around the internet reading about 3D rendering,
        physics simulation, software development or programming in general; from time
        to time he assumes the role of a content producer (instead of just a lurker),
        creating small pieces of software on <a href="https://github.com/joaoportela">
        github</a> or helping people on <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/86845/joao-portela">stackoverflow</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also likes to play computer games and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is also not sure if <a href="https://youtu.be/XP9pnSXhibw?t=4m41s">
        writing in third person is working</a> as expected. :)
